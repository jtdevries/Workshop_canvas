----------
#### Step_1
###### In the first step we will create our canvas and make it interactable by creating simple dots with a mouse press.
----------
#### Step_2
###### In this second step we will add eventlisteners for mousedown and mouseup enabeling us to continuously draw dots as we press the mouse down and drag it across the canvas.
----------
#### Step_3
###### Step 3 will show you how we connect the dots with a Path so that we can actually draw a smooth line!
----------
#### Step_4
###### Here we will add the functionality to increase or decrease the Radius of our line, and make it interactive via a toolbar. This example uses Bootstrap but feel free to give it a personal touch.
----------
#### Step_5
###### Now its time to add some COLOR. here we will add color Swatches to the toolbar.
